## Personal Webpage
# Challenge #2 Week 2:


# Project Description
### What is this project?
The project that was assigned to me is a personal website. Using HTML and CSS components only. It includes a simple 'about me', projects that I have completed, and finally a contact section on the bottom of the page.

### Files modified
I worked on two main files including: html file titled index.html and a css file titled style.css. Completed the structure and styling of the website. Followed with styling of of it.

### Challenges
CSS is definitely a skill I will always need to develop. One feature that really challenged me was the media query.
